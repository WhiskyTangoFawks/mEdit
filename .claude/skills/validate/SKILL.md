# Validate

Creates `validation-plan.md` to hand off to a fresh session. Run at end of any implementation task.

## Step 1 — Determine scope

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD && git diff --name-only --cached
```

Classify each changed file:

- **Backend**: `MEditService/**/*.cs`
- **Frontend**: `medit-vscode/**/*.ts`, `medit-vscode/**/*.tsx`, `package.json`, `src/generated/api.ts`
- **Core CS** (mutation eligible): `MEditService/MEditService.Core/**/*.cs`
- **Config/docs only**: nothing in Backend or Frontend buckets

## Step 2 — Determine run-gates command

From scope, build the exact command:

| Scope | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| Backend only | `bash .claude/skills/validate/run-gates.sh --backend` |
| Frontend only | `bash .claude/skills/validate/run-gates.sh --frontend` |
| Both | `bash .claude/skills/validate/run-gates.sh --backend --frontend` |
| Config/docs only | *(omit Step 1 from execution plan)* |

## Step 3 — Identify task files

Include any task `.md` files explicitly in use during this session (known from conversation context — do not scan). If none, write "none".

## Step 4 — Write `validation-plan.md`

Write to the project root:

```markdown
# Validation Plan

> **EXECUTE this plan immediately — do not re-plan or summarize it. Start Step 1 now.**

## Work Summary
<1–3 sentences describing what was implemented or changed>

## Files Changed
<file list from git diff>

## Scope
- Backend: yes/no
- Frontend: yes/no
- Core CS (mutation eligible): yes/no
- Config/docs only: yes/no

## Task Files
<list of paths and what to mark complete, or "none">

## Execution

### Step 1 — Mechanical gates
<exact command from Step 2 above>

All scope failures reported together — fix all, then rerun. With TDD, expect pass on first run.

### Step 2 — Simplify (LLM)
/simplify

Review findings with developer, propose which to accept/reject, and wait for the developers decision before continuing. If simplify changes logic (not just style), rerun Step 1. Any larger findings requiring architectural refactoring shold be prompted to the developer for potential creation of a /handoff document to address the finding.

### Step 3 — Code review (LLM)
/code-review

Review findings with developer, propose which to accept/reject, and wait for the developers decision before continuing. If any changes are made, rerun Step 1. Any larger findings requiring architectural refactoring shold be prompted to the developer for potential creation of a /handoff document to address the finding.

### Step 4 — Mutation tests (only if Core CS changed)
cd MEditService && bash ../.claude/skills/mutation-test/run.sh
Triage survivors per /mutation-test.

## Completion
When all steps pass:
1. Update task files listed above
2. `rm validation-plan.md`

## Git Commit
Create a commit with a message referencing the task and summarizing the work, e.g. "Implement X feature [Task-123]". If multiple tasks, list them all. If no explicit tasks, write "no task file". Prompt the user to review and edit the commit message before finalizing. Then commit the changes.
```

## Step 5 — Hand off

Tell the user `validation-plan.md` is ready. Starting a new session to execute it is the implicit approval.
