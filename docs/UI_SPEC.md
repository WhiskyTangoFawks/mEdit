# mEdit — Functional UI Specification

This document is the canonical description of mEdit's frontend surfaces. Each section describes what is shown, what interactions are available, and what data drives them. Implementation phases should be designed against this spec; when a phase changes the intended behavior, update this document first.

---

## Overall Layout

mEdit is a VS Code extension. Its UI is composed of three surfaces:

1. **Sidebar tree** (VS Code activity bar panel) — the entry point for all navigation
2. **Record editor panel** (VS Code editor tab, webview) — the main work surface; one tab per open record
3. **Status bar item** — backend connection state; bottom of VS Code window

There is no toolbar or top-level menu bar. All actions are reachable from the sidebar tree context menu, the command palette, or the record editor panel itself.

---

## 1. Status Bar

The status bar item sits in the bottom-right of the VS Code window.

| Backend state | Label | Color |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Not running | "mEdit: backend not running" | warning (yellow) |
| Connecting | "mEdit: connecting…" | default |
| Attached, no session | "mEdit: no session" | default |
| Attached, session loaded | "mEdit: {GameRelease} — {N} plugins" | success (green) |

Clicking the item when the backend is not running shows a notification with instructions to start it. Clicking when attached opens the session wizard if no session is loaded, or does nothing if a session is already active.

---

## 2. Sidebar Tree

The sidebar tree is the primary navigation surface. It is a VS Code `TreeView` registered under the `mEdit` view container.

### 2.1 Top-Level Nodes

When no session is loaded:
- Single informational node: "No session — click to load…"; activating it runs `mEdit.loadSession`.

When a session is loaded, top-level nodes are:

| Node | Label | Children |
|------|-------|---------|
| Plugins | One node per loaded plugin | Record type nodes |
| Conflicts | "Conflicts ({N})" — lazy-loaded count | Conflict record nodes (Phase 9) |
| Worldspaces | "Worldspaces" | WRLD record nodes (Phase 16) |
| Interior Cells | "Interior Cells" | CELL record nodes (Phase 16) |

### 2.2 Plugin Nodes

Label: `{PluginName}` (e.g. `Fallout4.esm`, `MyMod.esp`)

Icon: lock icon for immutable plugins. No icon for editable plugins.

Context menu (`contextValue: "plugin"` / `"pluginImmutable"`):

| Action | Available on | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| New Plugin… | Always | Opens name/type picker; calls `POST /plugins/create` |
| Add New Record… | Editable only | Opens type picker; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/records` (Phase 10) |
| Copy as Override Into… | Always | Plugin picker; calls copy-to |
| Compact FormIDs | Editable only | Confirmation dialog; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/compact-formids` (Phase 14) |
| Convert to ESL / ESM | Editable only | Type picker; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/convert` (Phase 14) |
| Add Master… | Editable only | Master name input; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/masters/add` (Phase 14) |
| Sort Masters | Editable only | Immediate; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/masters/sort` (Phase 14) |
| Clean Masters | Editable only | Confirmation; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/masters/clean` (Phase 14) |
| Inject Forms into Master… | Editable only | Confirmation; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/records/inject-to-master` (Phase 14) |
| Run Script… | Editable only | QuickPick from `GET /scripts`; calls `POST /script/run` (Phase 15) |
| Merge Into… | Editable only | Target picker; confirmation; calls `POST /plugins/merge` (Phase 14) |

### 2.3 Record Type Nodes

Label: `{RecordTypeName}` (e.g. `NPC_`, `WEAP`, `CELL`)

Context menu: none currently defined.

Children: Record nodes (paginated; "Load more…" node at end of page).

### 2.4 Record Nodes

Label: `{EditorID}  [{RecordType}:{FormID}]` — EditorID first, then FormKey components. If EditorID is absent, show FormKey only.

Conflict badge icon overlaid on node icon when the record has a conflict or change-lost state (Phase 9).

Context menu (`contextValue: "record"`):

| Action | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Open Record | Default action (also triggered by single click); runs `mEdit.openEditor` |
| Copy as Override Into… | Plugin picker; calls copy-to |
| Copy as New Record Into… | Plugin picker; calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/records` with template (Phase 10) |
| Remove Record | Plugin picker (which plugin's override to delete); confirmation; calls `POST /records/delete` (Phase 10) |
| Show Referenced By | Opens record editor on the "Referenced By" tab (Phase 11) |
| Run Script… | Context is this record; QuickPick from `GET /scripts` (Phase 15) |

### 2.5 Filter Toolbar (Phase 9)

Above the tree, a compact toolbar row:

- Free-text search box: filters by EditorID prefix or exact FormKey; debounced; maps to `editorId` query param on `GET /records`
- Conflict state toggle buttons: "All" / "Conflicts" / "Overrides" / "Clean"
- Record type dropdown (optional; narrows to one record type)

Filters compose as AND. Clearing all filters returns to the full tree.

### 2.6 Worldspace/Interior Cell Tree (Phase 16)

Under the "Worldspaces" top-level node:

```
Worldspaces
  └─ SomeWorld [WRLD:000007]
       └─ Block (0, 0)
            └─ Sub-block (0, 0)
                 └─ Cell (12, -5)   ← XCLC coordinates
                      ├─ Persistent
                      │    └─ barrelRef [REFR:001234]
                      └─ Temporary
                           └─ npcRef [REFR:002345]
```

Block and Sub-block nodes are grouping nodes only (no record, no click action). Clicking a CELL or REFR node opens the record editor.

---

## 3. Record Editor Panel

The record editor is a VS Code webview panel opened by `mEdit.openEditor`. One panel can be open at a time (reused when navigating between records — see extension invariant). The panel is a React app.

### 3.1 Panel Header

- Record identity: `{RecordType} / {EditorID}` (or FormKey if no EditorID)
- FormKey display: `{FormID}:{OriginPlugin}`
- Tab bar: "Fields" | "Referenced By" (Phase 11)

### 3.2 Fields Tab — Compare Grid

The compare grid is the primary view. Layout:

- **Rows**: one per field. Fields without any value across all plugins are hidden by default.
- **Columns**: one per plugin that contains this record's FormKey. Plugins appear in load order (left = lowest / master, right = highest / winning override). An additional "Pending" column appears for any plugin with staged changes.

#### Column Header

Displays plugin name as a chip. Immutable plugins show a lock icon.

**Interactions:**
- Left-click: collapse/expand the column (collapsed = chip only, no cell content). Collapsed state persisted in session.
- Right-click: context menu (Phase 17):
  - "Copy All to Pending" — copies all field values as pending changes into the active editable plugin
  - "Copy as New Record" — copies as a new record pending change
  - "Remove Override" — stages deletion of this plugin's override (Phase 10; disabled for immutable)

#### Field Rows

Each row:

| Sub-column | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Field name | Label derived from Mutagen property name (e.g. "Height", "Race", "Keywords") |
| Plugin cells | One cell per plugin column |

Conflict color coding applied to the entire row background and to individual cells (see §3.3).

#### Cell Types (by field schema `type`)

| Schema type | Read mode | Edit mode |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| `string` | Plain text | `<input type="text">` |
| `int` / `float` | Number | `<input type="number">` |
| `bool` | "Yes" / "No" | Toggle / checkbox |
| `enum` | Enum name (not raw integer) | `<select>` with option per `enumValues` entry |
| `flags` | Comma-separated active flag names | Multi-select dropdown with per-flag checkboxes |
| `formKey` | EditorID (hyperlink) — clicking opens that record | `<FormKeyPicker>` — search by EditorID, filtered by `validFormKeyTypes` |
| `struct` | Collapsed summary | `<StructRowGroup>` — child rows per sub-field (Phase 12) |
| `array` | "{N} items" | `<ArrayRowGroup>` — child rows per element, add/remove buttons (Phase 12) |

Pending-change cells show the new value with a yellow background and a revert (×) button.

**Drag-drop (Phase 17):** In edit mode, cells can be dragged between plugin columns. Dropping copies the source value as a pending field change into the target column's plugin. Target must be editable.

#### Conflict Color Coding (Phase 9)

Row and cell background by conflict state of that field value across the override stack:

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| No override (record in one plugin) | No highlight |
| Override — all plugins agree on this field | Green background |
| Change lost — this plugin changes the field, but a later plugin reverts it | Yellow background |
| Conflict — plugins disagree, last-in-stack wins | Red background |

Cell text: red text when this cell's value is present in the override stack but overwritten by a later plugin (the "losing" value).

### 3.3 Referenced By Tab (Phase 11)

Lazy-loaded on tab click. Calls `GET /records/{formKey}/references`.

Displays a list of records that hold a FormLink pointing to this record:

```
{PluginName}   {RecordType} / {EditorID}   field: {FieldPath}
```

Each row is clickable — opens that referencing record in the editor.

Empty state: "No references found."

### 3.4 Edit Mode Controls

Edit mode is entered by clicking "Edit" in the panel toolbar (or selecting an editable cell).

Toolbar buttons when in edit mode:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Save | Calls `POST /plugins/{plugin}/save` for all plugins with pending changes |
| Revert All | Calls `DELETE /changes` for this record |
| Copy to… | Plugin picker; copies current field values as override into selected plugin |

Per-field revert (×) button appears on each pending cell.

---

## 4. Pending Changes Panel (Phase B design)

> Design not yet finalized. See Phase B open questions in TASKS.md.

Intent: a sidebar or bottom panel showing all staged changes across all records, grouped by plugin and optionally by `ChangeGroup`. Supports per-field revert, per-record revert, per-group revert, and save. This is the primary control surface for multi-record operations (delete, renumber).

---

## 5. Command Palette Commands

All `mEdit.*` commands are available in the command palette. The full list is the canonical registry in `package.json` `contributes.commands`. Commands relevant to navigation and common workflows:

| Command ID | Title | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `mEdit.loadSession` | mEdit: Load Session | Runs session wizard |
| `mEdit.openEditor` | mEdit: Open Record Editor | Internal; also bound to tree click |
| `mEdit.newPlugin` | mEdit: New Plugin… | Prompts for name and type |
| `mEdit.copyAsOverride` | mEdit: Copy as Override Into… | Requires active record panel |
| `mEdit.showConflicts` | mEdit: Show Conflicts | Focuses the Conflicts tree node (Phase 9) |
| `mEdit.runScript` | mEdit: Run Script… | QuickPick; context = active record if panel open, else global (Phase 15) |

---

## 6. Field Type Rendering Rules (Summary)

These rules apply everywhere a field value is rendered — in the compare grid, the pending changes panel, and any future surfaces.

1. **Never display raw integers for enums or flags.** Always resolve to name(s).
2. **FormKeys render as EditorID hyperlinks** when the referenced record is in the index; fall back to FormKey string if not resolved.
3. **Structs and arrays are always collapsible.** Default collapsed. Expand state is per-session, not persisted across restarts.
4. **Pending values** always show the new value (not the old), with a yellow background and a revert button.
5. **Null / missing fields** render as an empty cell, not "null" or "undefined".
6. **Read-only cells** in immutable plugin columns are never editable; no input is rendered on click.
