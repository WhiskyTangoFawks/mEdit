# One active session at a time

The backend holds a single active session (one game release + load order). Multiple concurrent sessions are not supported.

A load order is specific to a game installation and represents a coherent state the game would actually run. Allowing multiple concurrent sessions would require every query — record lookup, conflict detection, FormKey resolution — to be scoped by session, adding significant complexity for an edge case. If a user wants to compare two load orders, the workflow is: note what you need, close the session, reload with the other load order.

This is a v1 constraint. Revisit if cross-load-order comparison becomes a meaningful use case.
