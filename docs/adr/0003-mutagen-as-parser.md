# Mutagen used as a direct C# library for plugin parsing

Mutagen is used as a NuGet library, not shelled out via CLI. It provides strongly-typed C# objects for every record type in every supported Bethesda game, and handles binary I/O, FormID↔FormKey resolution, master list management, and record schema validation. Using it directly gives full programmatic access to all record types.

## Considered options

**Spriggit CLI** — A CLI wrapper around Mutagen for YAML serialization. Adds a process boundary and constrains the interface to what Spriggit exposes. Rejected.

**xedit-lib** — The Delphi/Pascal library underlying xEdit. Requires native interop, is not idiomatic in any modern language, and has a narrow maintainer surface. Rejected.

**Custom binary parser** — No justification when Mutagen exists, is actively maintained, and covers all target games. Rejected.
