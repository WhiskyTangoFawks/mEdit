# ADR-0016: Two-axis conflict model (ConflictAll + ConflictThis)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-06-02

## Context

CONTEXT.md describes a four-state conflict model (No Override, Override, Change Lost, Conflict) derived from xEdit's visible UI states. Phase 9 was designed around this model.

Investigation of the TES5Edit source (`xeMainForm.pas`, `wbInterface.pas`, `wbImplementation.pas`) revealed that xEdit actually tracks conflict state on **two independent axes**:

- **ConflictThis** — this plugin's version of the record relative to the rest of the stack. Classifies each cell in the compare grid individually.
- **ConflictAll** — the summary classification for the entire override stack. Classifies each row (record) as a whole.

The two axes are separate because a record's overall status (`ConflictAll`) and any given plugin's specific contribution (`ConflictThis`) are different questions. A record may be a `caConflict` overall while the master plugin's version is `ctMaster` and the winning plugin's version is `ctConflictWins`.

Our original four states are actually a subset of `ConflictAll`. Implementing only the four-state model would prevent per-cell color coding and conflate "the record has a conflict" with "this plugin is the conflict winner/loser" — two UI concepts that drive different actions.

### xEdit's full enum sets (verified from source)

`TConflictAll` (row-level, background color):
- `caUnknown` — not yet computed
- `caOnlyOne` — record exists in one plugin only
- `caNoConflict` — all overrides agree on all fields
- `caConflictBenign` — differences exist but all are marked low-priority (cosmetic/redundant)
- `caOverride` — one plugin overrides but the change is uncontested
- `caConflict` — two or more plugins disagree; last-wins
- `caConflictCritical` — injected records or fields explicitly marked critical are in conflict

`TConflictThis` (per-plugin cell, font color / cell background):
- `ctUnknown` / `ctNotDefined` — structural absence / not computed
- `ctIgnored` — field has `cpIgnore` priority; excluded from conflict logic
- `ctOnlyOne` — single-plugin mode
- `ctMaster` — this is the originating (first-in-stack) plugin
- `ctIdenticalToMaster` — same values as the master; benign override
- `ctConflictBenign` — differs but priority-capped at benign
- `ctOverride` — uncontested override (different from master but no one else changes it)
- `ctConflictWins` — wins the conflict (last plugin to change this field)
- `ctConflictLoses` — loses the conflict (overwritten by a later plugin)

### ConflictPriority modifies the outcome

Every field definition carries a `ConflictPriority` that the algorithm consults before classifying:

| Priority | Effect on detection |
|---|---|
| `cpIgnore` | Field excluded from conflict detection entirely |
| `cpBenign` | Differences capped at `caConflictBenign` / `ctConflictBenign` |
| `cpBenignIfAdded` | Treated as benign if absent in the master (used on XLRL Location Reference) |
| `cpNormal` | Standard comparison |
| `cpNormalIgnoreEmpty` | Master absence treated as non-conflicting (used on DOBJ, actor templates) |
| `cpOverride` | Per-plugin result capped at `ctOverride` (no red cell) |
| `cpCritical` | Bumps to `caConflictCritical` if non-empty values differ |

Injected records (FormKey from a master the plugin doesn't formally declare) are automatically treated as `cpCritical`.

### Comparison uses resolved display values, not raw binary

xEdit compares `DisplaySortKey` values — the human-readable resolved form — not raw bytes. Two records can have different binary representations but be considered identical (e.g. a FormID that resolves to the same target across different load-order slots).

### PartialForm records are sparse by design

A record with the `IsPartialForm` header flag intentionally omits fields it doesn't override. These absent fields are treated as `cpIgnore` in conflict detection — not as "empty values that differ from the master." Displaying partial-form absent fields as blank cells would mislead users into thinking the plugin is explicitly setting those fields to null.

### Sorted vs unsorted arrays

`wbArrayS` (sorted) arrays in xEdit must be matched by sort key before comparing elements, not by array index. Positional mismatch between two versions of a sorted array is not a conflict — the arrays just need to be sorted first. For unsorted arrays (e.g. quest script fragments: OnBegin, OnEnd, OnChange), order is semantically significant and positional mismatch is a real conflict.

## Decision

**Adopt the two-axis model.** Every override-stack computation produces both a `ConflictAll` for the record and a `ConflictThis` for each plugin's version. Both are returned by the API and used in the UI.

**Implementation in two tiers:**

**Tier 1 (Phase 9):** Full two-axis classification using Mutagen field values for comparison. `ConflictThis` and `ConflictAll` values match xEdit semantics for the common cases (identical-to-master, override, conflict wins/loses). `cpBenign`, `cpIgnore`, and `cpCritical` are deferred.

**Tier 2 (later phase):** Per-field `ConflictPriority` refinement, `cpBenignIfAdded` (XLRL), `cpNormalIgnoreEmpty` (DOBJ/actor templates), and sorted-array element matching. These require the TES5Edit field definitions as a reference table.

**Update CONTEXT.md** conflict state glossary to reflect the two-axis model and retire the simplified four-state definitions.

**Do not implement a five-state or six-state simplification.** The temptation to flatten the two axes into a single summary is strong, but it destroys the per-cell information that makes xEdit's grid readable. The UI needs both axes.

## Implementation notes

- `ConflictClassifier` in `MEditService.Core/Queries/` is the right home. It takes the ordered list of override records (from `IRecordRepository`) and returns `(ConflictAll, IReadOnlyList<(plugin, ConflictThis)>)`.
- Comparison should use Mutagen's typed field values where available. Raw bytes are acceptable as a fallback but will miss cases where two representations are semantically equal (FormID slot remapping being the most common).
- The `IsPartialForm` flag on `IFormRecord` must be checked before building override column data; absent fields in a partial form are omitted from the column entirely, not shown as blank.
- `ConflictAll` and `ConflictThis` are cached per FormKey and invalidated on index update (same lifecycle as DuckDB rows today).

## Alternatives rejected

**Keep the four-state model** — cannot drive per-cell color coding. The "Change Lost" state (a mid-stack change overwritten by a later plugin) maps to `ctConflictLoses` on a specific plugin column, which requires ConflictThis to exist at all.

**Implement ConflictPriority in Tier 1** — the priority table is derived from the xEdit definition files and requires building a lookup table of `(record_type, field_name) → priority`. This is significant additional work and can be added incrementally once the base two-axis model is working.

**Compute conflict state in DuckDB SQL** — conflict classification requires iterating the override stack in load-order position and comparing field values across rows. DuckDB's `GROUP BY` + `COUNT(DISTINCT value)` approximation would give a binary "agrees/disagrees" per field but cannot produce `ConflictThis` per plugin or distinguish `ctConflictWins` from `ctConflictLoses`. The classification belongs in C# using the full record objects, with results persisted to DuckDB for filtering.
